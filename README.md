# Rock_Paper_Scissors
Multi-class Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

Abstract
Rock Paper Scissors is a dataset containing 2,892 images of diverse hands in Rock/Paper/Scissors poses. It is licensed CC By 2.0 and available for all purposes, but it’s intent is primarily for learning and research.

Overview
Rock Paper Scissors contains images from a variety of different hands,  from different races, ages and genders, posed into Rock / Paper or Scissors and labelled as such. You can download the training set here, and the test set here. These images have all been generated using CGI techniques as an experiment in determining if a CGI-based dataset can be used for classification against real images.

Note that all of this data is posed against a white background.

Each image is 300×300 pixels in 24-bit color

I have used test images taken on my phone with white background.
